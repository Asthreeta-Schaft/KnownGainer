                <h3>Learn Web Development in the easiest way</h3>
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). ... Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.
                <br><br>
                HTML is the predominant markup language online,  but even the latest iterations of the standard leave a lot to be desired when it comes to accessibility. That's where ARIA comes in. In this series, I'm going to introduce ARIA and show you some practical examples of how ARIA can be used for different kinds of sites and apps.
                <br><br>
                ARIA is an important feature that web developers can use to help make their sites more accessible. In previous pieces, we talked about how you can implement ARIA, whether you’re doing so on an eCommerce site or in more niche places.
                <br><br>
                So far, the focus of this series has been on how to implement ARIA—for example, how to add a role to an element or how to code more accessible forms. With this piece, the focus is going to shift a bit towards other aspects of online accessibility, like why and when we should use ARIA. We’ll also cover some common questions asked on previous posts throughout the series.
                <br><br>
                HTML has some shortcomings when it comes to how elements are defined and how elements can be related to one another.
                <br><br>
                In many cases, HTML elements (such as the div tag) are too broadly defined to be useful to someone navigating a site with a screen reader, or an element may have too many possible meanings to be interpreted (e.g. an image could also be used as a button). ARIA adds additional attributes to HTML elements to allow for definitions that can be layered on top of the already existing markup language, adding clarity as needed.
                <br><br>
                The second major benefit is the relation of elements. With HTML, every element exists as a child and/or a parent of another element. But this structure doesn't capture all semantic relationships. This can lead to scenarios like a controller and the element it controls not being clearly associated if they are placed in separate div containers. This becomes increasingly important in complex site structures or when altering the DOM using JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                Beyond those two benefits, there are a host of others that tend to get less attention, but provide excellent functionality nonetheless.</p>

            <div class="post" id="App-Dev">
                <h3>App Development</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve entered the pre-launch phase in your app’s life, you must turn your attention over to marketing and planning. This part of the process is crucial to the success of your mobile app.
                <br><br>
                It is important for your app to have a website. Not a browser version of your app, but a website or a landing page that acts as an overview of the app and directs traffic to the App Store. This website must be clean, appealing, and clearly show potential users what the app is for and its main features.
                <br><br>
                It must also have an obvious section that can be filled out for people to be notified (usually by email) of when the app is launched. This part is most important because external traffic is going to be directed here to help establish a potential initial user base. Make sure that all other forms of marketing for the app, including social media accounts and pre-launch reviews or press releases, direct the viewer to this website and the signup form.
                <br><br>
                You’ll want to reach out to media outlets to get your app reviewed or feature a press release. Gathering these links back to your app-launch website will immensely help generate an initial user base. To generate publicity, you’ll need to reach out to relevant journalists and other writers with a link to a full press kit to make it easy for them to see all the information about your app in one place. Follow up if they don’t respond in a timely manner, and if they do show interest, direct them to a clean, bug-free beta version that they can try out. Social media and review websites are also great ways to get some buzz going about your mobile app!
                <br><br>
                Creating an informative press kit is crucial to get more press coverage. It should provide information on all the unique and important features of your mobile app. You need this to help media, bloggers, and influencers get an easy way to promote your mobile application.
                <br><br>
                Not strictly necessary but highly recommended is for you to open a beta version of your app up to a beta tester group. This group is given exclusive access to the app before launch and is given the task of fully using the app and taking note of any bugs, unclear UI, annoying UX, or logic gaps, and general feedback about the app.
                <br><br>

            <div class="post" id="Crypto">
                <h3>CryptoCurrency</h3>
                <p>Forcepoint Security Labs have encountered an ongoing Trickbot campaign that appears to target crypto-currencies. Trickbot is a banking Trojan that is traditionally known to target financial institutions. Recently, we have observed Trickbot targeting Paypal and expanding its list of target institutions to include those from Nordic countries.
                <br><br>
                When Bitcoin (BTC) first appeared in 2009, few people had a clear idea of what it was, let alone the waves it would generate both financially and technologically. The underlying blockchain technology was more or less a new concept, and like most new concepts was poorly understood in general. In 2018, blockchain remains a hot topic: while it is tied in many people’s minds to cryptocurrencies, it is actually a standalone concept on which cryptocurrencies can be based. This article will clarify how blockchains work and, just as importantly, where blockchain ends and technologies based on it begin.
                <br><br>
                The purpose of blockchain is to create a ledger; that is, a record of historical transactions (be those financial transactions, messages, etc.).
                <br><br>
                Fundamentally, the blockchain is aptly named: it is a chain of blocks of data which at their most basic level (at least in most current implementations) can be conceptualised as something similar to the diagram below, which is based on the blockchain as famously implemented by Bitcoin.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps a truism of security is that nothing is inherently tamper-proof: it has to be designed to make tampering difficult and then protected by as many anti-tampering controls as possible. It shouldn’t, therefore, come as a surprise that blockchains are not themselves tamper-proof without some additional controls.
                <br><br>
                The first of these controls is distribution and decentralisation: by ensuring that all interested parties have access to the ledger and any new transactions which are supposed to be added to it, tampering should become much more evident. If all of the parties involved have access to the same information, an attempt by anything less than a majority of stakeholders to incorrectly report a transaction will be noticed by all of the other parties who are processing the data honestly.
                <br><br>

            <div class="post" id="Blockchain">
                <h3>Blockchain</h3>
                <p>Since the last year we have seen growing interest in Blockchain, and it’s plain to see why – the technology is totally re-wiring commerce. It’s driving efficiencies, lowering costs, and opening up new revenue streams. No wonder senior executives are paying attention. According to Deloitte, 77% of financial leaders are worried that they will miss out on an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don’t adopt Blockchain. It’s a big turnaround from a few years ago when Blockchain barely registered on the radar of most companies.
                <br><br>
                Considering the evolution of distributed ledger technologies, it’s not surprising that blockchain interoperability has become a necessity. More and more companies are using different distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) for different use cases across separate ecosystems, and increasingly, they’re using multiple DLTs across their organisations. Interoperability between blockchain consortiums is picking up speed – as seen in this announcement between Oracle blockchain based Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) and digital trade finance network Contour based on R3 Corda. Enterprises are also having to pivot to meet their clients’ needs. We’ve come across cases where a client is operating on a different platform to an enterprise, necessitating the latter to integrate into their client’s DLT irrespective of what DLT they’re using.
                <br><br>
                Oracle’s focus on blockchain interoperability started in the early days of Oracle Blockchain Platform release in 2018 with built-in interoperability with other Hyperledger Fabric nodes and continued since with certifications and production customer deployments mixing Oracle blockchain nodes with those from IBM blockchain, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud Blockchain-as-a-Service, and others based on the work of Hyperledger Fabric Interoperability Workgroup. This enables the first facet of interoperability – a single decentralized ledger to operate in multi-vendor networks across multiple clouds or hybrid deployments with on-premises nodes. Second facet of interoperability is supporting different smart contract frameworks, in addition to the native Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts. Oracle also announced support for running Solidity smart contracts on OBP nodes using Hyperledger Burrow EVM since 20.3.3 release in December 2020. This means that developers can use OBP/Fabric ledger and infrastructure but develop in DAML or Solidity.  
                <br><br>
                Third and perhaps the most challenging facet of interoperability is cross-ledger support when different technologies and protocols are involved. A few open source efforts are focused on this challenge, including Hyperledger Cactus project, and interoperability has recently been added as SG7 working group in ISO TC/307 standards committee on Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. While these efforts are progressing, none have yet produced enterprise-grade solution ready for production. In parallel, Oracle fintech partner Quant has been working with Oracle and the Oracle Blockchain Platform team to address these challenges with a production-ready solution. The partnership has resulted in Oracle certifying Overledger for interoperability with Oracle Blockchain Platform. For customers looking for production-ready infrastructure to support cross-ledger interoperability between Oracle Blockchain Platform and other ledger technologies, Quant provides an immediately available solution certified in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
                <br><br>
                Oracle fully understands these issues, which is why the partnership works so well. Quant is now working in a highly collaborative manner with Oracle to rollout solutions on the Oracle Blockchain platform for a variety of sectors. A key sector that we’re engaged in is financial services. There are specific challenges that come with Blockchain interoperability in finance, including identity mapping, privacy, security, data protection and disintermediation – all of which Quant and Oracle are jointly working on.
                <br><br>
                The modular architecture of Quant’s flagship product – Overledger – is perfect for addressing these challenges. There are three layers to Overledger. There’s the gateway component, where users can send API requests using Quant’s prep-execute model. Supporting this layer is a collection of services that provide core interaction functionality with multiple DLTs. Customers can use these services for a variety of functions – to read data from a Blockchain, write transactions to a Blockchain, and subscribe to Blockchain event information. Lastly, there’s a connector layer for multiple DLTs, including: Hyperledger Fabric and Oracle Blockchain Platform, Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu, R3 Corda, Ripple, and Bitcoin. To add different DLTs, users need specific connectors. Each connector type can be re-used across multiple instances of the same Blockchain technology. For example, the Ethereum connector can be used to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet, an Ethereum testnet, or a private Ethereum network.

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p>Since OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company, introduced its groundbreaking GPT-3 natural language model platform last year, users have discovered countless things that these AI models can do with their powerful and comprehensive understanding of language.
                <br><br>
                For instance, a sports franchise that’s developing a new app to engage with fans during games could use the models’ ability to quickly and abstractly summarize information to convert transcripts of live television commentary into game highlights that someone could choose to include within the app.
                <br><br>
                The marketing team could use GPT-3’s capability to generate original content and its understanding of what’s happening in the game to help the team brainstorm ideas for social media or blog posts and engage with fans more quickly.
                <br><br>
                At its Ignite conference today, Microsoft announced it will help its customers uncover these kinds of experiences with the new Azure OpenAI Service, which allows access to OpenAI’s API through the Azure platform and will initially be available by invite only. The new Azure Cognitive Service will give customers access to OpenAI’s powerful GPT-3 models, along with security, reliability, compliance, data privacy and other enterprise-grade capabilities that are built into Microsoft Azure.
                <br><br>
                Microsoft will also offer Azure OpenAI Service customers new tools to help ensure outputs that the model returns are appropriate for their businesses, and it will monitor how people are employing the technology to help ensure it’s being used for its intended purposes.
                <br><br>
                “We are just in the beginning stages of figuring out what the power and potential of GPT-3 is, which is what makes it so interesting,” said Eric Boyd, Microsoft corporate vice president for Azure AI. “Now we are taking what OpenAI has released and making it available with all the enterprise promises that businesses need to move into production.”

               <h3>Human Augmentation</h3>
              <p>Cyborg. What are Cyborgs? Definition, meaning, philosophy (with Cyborg Manifesto), movies (my top 5!), companies & 8 examples of cyborgs.
               <br><br>
               What is a cyborg? The word cyborg comes from the term cybernetic organism: the physical amalgamation of human and machine. Other terms for cyborg are artificial human, a mix of human and machine, or a bionic human.
               <br><br>
               The examples that most appeal to the imagination come from films, series and books. I personally think of Inspector Gadget, a detective in a cartoon with extendable arms and a helicopter that comes out of the top of his head. Other examples are the Borg from Star Trek, Major in Ghost in the Shell or The Six Billion Dollar Man. In the section on movies, I describe a number of other examples.
               <br><br>
               A cyborg is therefore different from a robot or an android. The last two are completely artificial, while a cyborg is always partly human.
               <br><br>
               The first description of the term Cyborg was in a scientific paper by Clynes and Kline in 1960. Their strategy for space travel: Man must adapt to life in space, not the other way around. The definition I use: a cyborg is part human and part machine.
               <br><br>
               Contemporary thinkers such as Donna Harraway (with her influential The Cyborg Manifesto), Andy Clark and Amber Case believe that today’s human beings, with their dependence on computers, the internet and mobile phones, are already a cyborg.
