    <p class="bigA">
        KnownGainer directly collects information when you:
    </p>
        
        <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
            
        <li>register for an KnownGainer user account and create an KnownGainer user profile;</li>
        
        <li>enroll and participate in online courses;</li>
        
        <li>purchase a product or service (for example,<a href="#glossary-verified-cert"> Badges</a>);</li>
        
        <li>send email messages to KnownGainer (including messages to learner support);</li>
        
        <li>participate in user surveys; and</li>
        
        <li>participate in public forums, webinars, and other interactive experiences on the<a href="#glossary-site"> KnownGainer Site.</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        KnownGainer also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the KnownGainer Site, as explained in the section below titled <a href="#glossary-cookies">Cookies</a> and <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        KnownGainer does not itself collect or store financial account numbers or identification issued by a governmental entity, employer, or other authority. Instead, if you choose to make a purchase on the KnownGainer Site, for example a<a href="#glossary-verified-cert"> Badges</a>, you will be directed to KnownGainer’s third-party payment processor and KnownGainer’s third-party ID verification service provider. If you do not wish to submit the required authentication or payment information, then you will not be able to obtain a certificate via the KnownGainer Site.
    </p>
    
    <p>KnownGainer requires your <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> limited circumstances when you:</p>
        
        <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
            <li>register for an KnownGainer user account (name, username, email address);</li>
            
            <li>purchase a <a href="#glossary-verified-cert">Badges</a> (so that KnownGainer’s third-party vendor can authenticate your identity) or other product or service (so that KnownGainer’s third-party vendor can process payment);</li>
            
            <li>participate in remote proctoring or other course facilitation processes (so that KnownGainer’s third-party vendor can monitor and assess the integrity of your course activity); or</li>
            
            <li>earn a<a href="#glossary-verified-cert"> Badges</a> (the certificate will have your name on it).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="section-account-profile"><b><em>To the extent that KnownGainer associates the information that KnownGainer collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> in your account profile.</em></b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You may voluntarily choose to share additional <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> on the KnownGainer Site, for example:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
        <li>in your KnownGainer account profile (and you may display a limited or full profile to other KnownGainer Site users);</li>
        
        <li>in applying for financial assistance; or</li>
        
        <li>when participating in a course, forum, webinar, or other interactive experience on the KnownGainer Site (noting that in some cases, this information is shared with a third party that provides tools or other assistance for the KnownGainer Site or a course).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        KnownGainer encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing additional <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> on the KnownGainer Site. (If you later choose to delete your KnownGainer account, deletion of your <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> will be subject to the process and limits outlined below.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Members do not receive your <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> unless and until you enroll in a course. If you enroll in a course, the <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> that offers the course will receive <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> from your KnownGainer account profile plus the information that KnownGainer collects about your activity and performance in the course in which you enrolled.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="glossary-cookies">Cookies And Tracking Technologies on the KnownGainer Site</h3>
    
    <p>
        Like many companies, KnownGainer uses<a href="#glossary-cookies"> Cookies</a> and other common <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a> on the<a href="#glossary-site"> KnownGainer Site</a> and in email communications to help KnownGainer better understand your use and needs of the KnownGainer Site, current and future KnownGainer-related products and services, and how KnownGainer and Members can improve. For example:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
        <li>based on your cookie settings, KnownGainer tracks information indicating, among other things, which pages of the KnownGainer Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used;</li>
        
        <li>KnownGainer may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software (including mobile use and device type when you use KnownGainer native mobile apps) you used when accessing the KnownGainer Site, and KnownGainer may be able to determine from an IP address your Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity; and</li>
        
        <li>KnownGainer may track and collect information from emails that KnownGainer sends to you, for example whether you opened the email or clicked on any links from the email.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        KnownGainer also partners with third parties to help us track and understand your activity on the KnownGainer Site, how you interact with KnownGainer’s social media, and how you find or may be referred to the KnownGainer Site. Individual Members may separately use <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a> within their courses and email communications to understand your activity within a course and how you find or may be referred to a course on the KnownGainer Site.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        KnownGainer and Members use Cookies and other <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a> for the following purposes:
    </p>

        <li>to support marketing by enabling KnownGainer and Members to deliver content relevant to your interests on the KnownGainer Site and third-party sites based on how you interact with KnownGainer or <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> advertisements or content. KnownGainer and Members use “first-party” cookies, which means cookies served by KnownGainer or an individual <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a>, and also “third-party” cookies, which means cookies served by third parties that help KnownGainer and Members track this information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        You have some options for managing Cookies and other <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a>. These include:</p>
        
        <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
            <li><u>Modifying your browser settings</u>: You should be able to control how and whether your web browser accepts Cookies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new Cookies, how to receive notification of new Cookies, and how to disable existing Cookies. If you reject KnownGainer’s Cookies, many functions and conveniences of the KnownGainer Site may not work properly.</li>
            
            <li><u>Opting-out of certain third-party tracking and advertising</u>: Some of the third parties used by KnownGainer or a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> for <a href="#glossary-cookies">Cookies</a> and <a href="#glossary-tracking-tech">Tracking Technologies</a> offer the ability to opt-out from their tracking by following processes described on their websites. A list of some such third parties is maintained and available at the KnownGainer learner Help Center and includes, for some, links to applicable opt-out processes.

        <h3 id="section-information-sharing" class="text-uppercase">How Your Information Is Shared</h3>
        
        <p>
            KnownGainer and Members share information, including <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a>, with third parties for the following purposes:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
            <li><b>With service providers, contractors, and other third parties that help carry out the uses described above</b> – KnownGainer requires third parties to: (1) abide by this Privacy Policy and applicable law; (2) handle <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> in a confidential manner and maintain adequate security; and (3) use <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> only as needed to fulfill the relevant purpose(s). In some cases, the KnownGainer Site and individual courses are integrated with third-party services or contain links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as service providers. These third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices, so you should pay attention anytime you are redirected to a third-party website and be sure to review its privacy policy.</li>
            
            <li><b>With other learners in courses that you take and with other visitors to the KnownGainer Site, to create an interactive learning environment, support class participation, and share course information</b> – This includes sharing comments, coursework, or other information or content that you submit to a portion of the<a href="#glossary-site"> KnownGainer Site</a> designed for viewing by other class Members or for public communication.

In such cases, KnownGainer and each <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> that offers a course in which you enrolled may use all information collected about you to determine who might be interested in communicating with you, but will only provide others your username (for clarity, no disclosure of your real name or email address).</li>
            
            <li><b>With employers, government programs, institutions, or other enterprises that sponsor your enrollment in a course for training or other educational purposes</b> – If an entity pays for or otherwise sponsors your<a href="#glossary-verified-cert"> Badges</a> or course participation, KnownGainer will share information with the entity as needed to confirm your enrollment, participation, progress, and completion status in that course.</li>
            
            <li><b>With affiliates of KnownGainer or a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a>, or with successors in the event of a merger, acquisition, or reorganization, for their use consistent with this Privacy Policy.</b></li>

        <p>
            KnownGainer or a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> may also seek your consent for additional disclosures of information, including <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a>, and will share it only as described to you. In addition, KnownGainer or a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> may share with the public and with third parties, including but not limited to researchers and business partners, information and <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> that is de-identified or aggregated in a manner that does not personally identify you.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="section-information-management" class="text-uppercase">How to Manage Your Personal Information</h3>
        
        <p>
            You can manage your <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> through learner features on the<a href="#glossary-site"> KnownGainer Site</a> and requests to the KnownGainer learner support team. If your request involves information controlled by a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a>, KnownGainer learner support will notify and coordinate with the appropriate <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> to address your request. KnownGainer will provide support to the extent required by applicable law (for example, learners in the Asian Union) and more broadly when possible, as a courtesy in our sole discretion. KnownGainer will notify you in the event that KnownGainer is unable to meet a request that is not legally required. Similarly, Members will only be obligated to comply with requests to the extent legally required, but may choose to comply with other requests in their sole discretion.

        <h4>Access and correct your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
            Much of your <a href="#glossary-personal-information">Personal Information</a> is available in your KnownGainer account. Your name, email address, and other identifiable profile information is editable through the profile settings in your KnownGainer account except as noted below. Your account dashboard lists all current and archived courses in which you have enrolled and includes links to any<a href="#glossary-verified-cert"> Badges</a> you may have earned. The dashboard also contains copies of your answers and other participation and performance in courses. Please contact KnownGainer learner support to access and update this or other information. If your request involves information controlled by a <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a>, KnownGainer learner support will notify the appropriate <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> of your request.

    <h4>Delete account and Personal Information</h4>
    
    <p id="section-deletion">
        To request deletion of your KnownGainer account and <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a>, you should click the button labeled “Delete my account” in your KnownGainer account settings. Because deletion on the KnownGainer system is a permanent action and cannot be reversed, KnownGainer may ask you to complete a process that aims to confirm your authority to manage the KnownGainer account affected by your request.
    </p>
    
    <p>With respect to your KnownGainer account, KnownGainer will <em>permanently</em>:</p>
    
    <ul class="mt-4 ml-4">

        <li>remove the active profile,</li>
        
        <li>retire your username, and</li>
        
        <li>remove you from KnownGainer email lists.</li>

    <p>
        With respect to your <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a>, KnownGainer will <em>permanently</em> delete your KnownGainer account profile <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> from the KnownGainer Site.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <a href="#section-account-profile">As noted above</a>, to the extent that KnownGainer associates the information that KnownGainer collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> in your KnownGainer account profile. By erasing the <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> in your KnownGainer account profile, the remaining information about your activity on the KnownGainer Site will no longer be associated with you, except as noted below.

        These changes will be applied to data stores that are used for operation of the KnownGainer Site including course administration by Members.

            <li>Deletion will not apply to historical activity logs or archives unless and until these logs and data naturally "age-off" the KnownGainer system.</li>

KnownGainer encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing your <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> on the KnownGainer Site.</li>
            
            <li>KnownGainer will archive course data (in a manner and to the extent permitted under applicable law) to serve its mission to enable scientific research on cognitive science and education. These archives are used to produce encrypted research data packages for Members, and <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> may not be deleted from research data packages retained by Members.</li>
            
            <li>KnownGainer and each applicable <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions. For example, records relating to previous purchases on the KnownGainer Site must be retained for financial reporting, audit, and compliance reasons.</li>
            
            <li>KnownGainer and each <a href="#glossary-member">Member</a> will retain and use <a href="#glossary-personal-information"> Personal Information</a> as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce its agreements, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</li>
